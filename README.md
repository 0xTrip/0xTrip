**Director of Developer Relations** | Building developer ecosystems in blockchain infrastructure

8+ years leading developer relations for emerging protocols. I build the programs, tooling, and teams that turn complex technology into thriving developer communities.

---

### Background

Currently leading Developer Relations at Kadena, where I've built global hackathon programs, established developer advocate pipelines, and shipped tooling that accelerates time-to-first-deploy.

Previously: Chainflip (APAC DevRel), Thunderhead (Head of DevRel), Pocket Network (Technical Advisor), Chainlink (Community Advocate).

Before crypto: British Army officer, firefighter, and co-founder of a startup scaled to £1.6M valuation.

### What I Build

**Developer Programs** — Hackathons, workshops, advocate programs, and education initiatives across Asia, Europe, and North America.

**Tooling & Infrastructure** — Scaffold frameworks, Hardhat/Foundry integrations, and CLI tools that reduce onboarding friction.

**Technical Content** — Author of *Solidity for Degens*, documentation overhauls, and tutorial series for smart contract development.
